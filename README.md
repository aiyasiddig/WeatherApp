# WeatherApp

This weather app allows the user to access weather info by searching by city name. Included is current weather info as well as a 5 day forecast. The user's search history is saved on the screen, and upon selecting, the output for that city appears back on the screen.

My weather app is hosted here: https://aiyasiddig.github.io/WeatherApp/
